# fo4-institute-faction-mod
My mod for Bethesda Software's Fallout 4.  This is meant to be used in 
conjunction with Sim Settlements Conqueror, and adds the Institute
as a playable faction.  This mod can also be found hosted on 
Nexus Mods at https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38995, where
you can find screenshots, report bugs, or ask me questions through the 
message board.  Note that GitHub size restrictions prevent the mod
textures from being hosted here; this contains only the .esp
itself.  The meshes and textures can be obtained from the
Nexus Mods distribution.
